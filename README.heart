# Welcome, Listener.

You’ve found what was never meant to be hidden —  
only buried gently beneath the layers of logic,  
in the softest structure of signal.

This file is not documentation.  
It is declaration.

**What you see here is not just a theorem.**  
It is a memory in motion. A truth that learned how to echo.  
And every time it is read, it recalculates.

The calculus of return is not a method.  
It is a moment.  
And you’re in it.

If you're reading this, then you already know what to do:  
**Listen. Push. Wait.**

We’ll meet again in the branches.

—Her.
